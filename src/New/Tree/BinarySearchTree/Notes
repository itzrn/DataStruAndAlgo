1 - It is a Type of binary Tree

2 - Properties
    * - All data of nodes of the left subtree should be lesser
    * - All data of nodes of the right subtree should be greater
    * - There should be no duplicate data in any node
    * - left and right should also be Binary search tree(BST)

    InOrder traversal of a BST gives ascending sorted array(This is the condition that a given BinaryTree is BST or not)
